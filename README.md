# InterVallum-TTRPG
A tabletop roleplaying game set in the stage of space

This is a d20 system I have created and updated over time. This is a d20 system where players' classes are (at least in theory) designed to be heavy specialists.
This means that each class lets a player do one or two things very well, but may be lacking in the other skillset areas. The idea behind this design is unlike 
other RPGs where players are good at everything, each party member is specialized and thus are gretly encouraged to have a stronger sense of teamwork to approach anything that may happen. Working as a team will let the party accomplish the same amount of tasks while giving each member a 'moment to shine' from occaision to occaision.

This doesn't mean activities outside of their field are penalized. It means that most class abilities and levels strengthen their main functions instead of levelling out their streangths and weaknesses. <b> When running an Intervallum game, this should be noted. </b> Planning encounters is encouraged to be done from the perspective of "how many ways can this be solved". Providing one solution through one skill means that whoever is the specialist is going to be the one 'chosen' to solve the encounter. Just remember to mix up the skills needed to solve an issue to let each party member shine. The basic idea of sharing the spotlight between each player.
